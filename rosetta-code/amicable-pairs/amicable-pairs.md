Two integers  N  and  M  are said to be amicable pairs if  N≠M  and the sum of the proper divisors of  N  ( sum(propDivs(N)) )  =M  as well as  sum(propDivs(M))=N .

Example:

1184 and 1210 are an amicable pair, with proper divisors:

1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 37, 74, 148, 296, 592 and
1, 2, 5, 10, 11, 22, 55, 110, 121, 242, 605 respectively.
Calculate and show here the Amicable pairs below 20,000 (there are eight).
