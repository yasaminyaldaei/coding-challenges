You are given a collection of ABC blocks (e.g., childhood alphabet blocks). There are 20 blocks with two letters on each block. A complete alphabet is guaranteed amongst all sides of the blocks. The sample collection of blocks:

(B O)
(X K)
(D Q)
(C P)
(N A)
(G T)
(R E)
(T G)
(Q D)
(F S)
(J W)
(H U)
(V I)
(A N)
(O B)
(E R)
(F S)
(L Y)
(P C)
(Z M)
Implement a function that takes a string (word) and determines whether the word can be spelled with the given collection of blocks.

Some rules to keep in mind:

Once a letter on a block is used, that block cannot be used again.
The function should be case-insensitive.
